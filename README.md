How to enable AUTOSAR in the hardware security module
The hardware security module (HSM) has appropriate firmware, which can guarantee the encryption of the system even in the case of insufficient resources.



for example, to verify communication partners and communication content and prevent interception. Proper implementation must allow real-time requirements. At first glance, this contradicts the computational time requirements of cryptographic methods. The hardware security module (HSM) is used to solve this problem. Allows to calculate the password on a separate processor. However, an optimized implementation is needed to realize its full potential.

In order to meet and realize the real-time requirements of the software, the AUTOSAR operating system divides the relevant software functions into sub-steps, so-called tasks. The task is activated by an external event, that is, marked as runnable, and then processed according to priority. For most applications, a timer with a cyclic activation table is used to activate the task, because the related control function will continue to process new signal generation. 

This will result in a default time response, which repeats in a period of tens of milliseconds. Several steps are required to ensure that real-time requirements are met. On the one hand, when implementing signal processing steps, appropriate measures must of course ensure that the required time response is provided. On the other hand, the activation of time-related tasks in the ECU must be able to meet the time requirements. For this reason, it is necessary to analyze the runtime behavior of all tasks to find an appropriate priority ordering and a chronological activation sequence with guaranteed time.

AUTOSAR basic software

The function of the ECU no longer only involves signal processing. The basic software that handles communication and management is an important part of these functions.  In short, 
there are two different sets of functions: 
A part of the basic software, for example for transmitting signal values, is necessary for real-time signal processing. This part must be given high priority appropriately. 
The other part has significantly lower real-time requirements: this part must run in the background regularly; however, it may be temporarily preempted by functions with higher real-time requirements.

Therefore, a common implementation pattern is to transfer these non-critical functions to low-priority background tasks. In this case, the problem is the order of priority between functions: Generally speaking, there are multiple background activities, none of which can fail for a long time. 

The solution to this sort of priority is round-robin scheduling, where each low-priority function is calculated for a short time, and then the next function. In AUTOSAR terminology, each module involved provides a so-called "MainFunction" with a limited running time. In background tasks, these functions are called in sequence.

Security

Safety

An example of this classic "background function" is a cryptographic algorithm. Since version 4.0, AUTOSAR has included the specifications of the encryption basic software-in subsequent versions, the corresponding specifications have been revised and fine-tuned. In this case, the so-called cryptographic service manager (CSM) provides cryptographic services to the application:

For example, it is used by Secure Onboard Communication (SecOC) to verify the signal value in the transmitted data packet in an encrypted manner. As the name suggests, CSM manages encryption services. The actual implementation is in a manufacturer-specific encryption library. In order to support integration into AUTOSAR systems with real-time requirements, CSM processes requests asynchronously: initially, they are only saved, and then processed one by one in the call of CSM MainFunction. To this end, the CSM MainFunction will call the mainformations of all the underlying encryption primitives, and each primitive will then have to calculate several steps.

The calculation time of a typical cryptographic primitive is an order of magnitude higher than the calculation time of a signal processing function. This brings up a dilemma when dividing MainFunction calls: What is the exact range allowed for calculation? Too many calculation steps will make the real-time performance of the entire system questioned, making encryption useless. Too few steps will delay the calculation of longer encryption operations, so that the benefits are limited.

In addition, another effect must be considered: a specific main function is responsible for managing its internal calculation state in order to allow the calculation to be performed gradually. On its own, this state management means overhead. The fewer the actual calculations for a single call, the greater the overhead.

Software vendors should find a standard solution to this problem. In classic scenarios, for example, runtime encryption is used to authenticate smaller data blocks through a symmetric encryption method. One solution might be to calculate a symmetric block for each MainFunction call. However, when using more complex methods, it is difficult to find a reasonable compromise.

Examples include verifying/encrypting large amounts of data or generating asymmetric signatures. For example, assuming that 100Âµs is calculated every millisecond is acceptable, this is a very optimistic assumption and it is difficult to maintain in most real-time scenarios.

an obvious solution is to use specialized hardware that can compute the appropriate algorithms-or most of them-in parallel with the main processor. Then AUTOSAR CSM and related encryption libraries only pass the request to this hardware, and in the main function, periodically check whether the result is available. The first of these hardware coprocessors has been designated as a "safe hardware extension" by the manufacturer's software program (HIS) in the past decade. Regarding cryptographic algorithms, this specification is still limited to the implementation of AES-128 in different modes. Therefore, recent developments are often due to a large number of hardware developments or not ideal, so more pure hardware is possible.
